# Proprietary XAUUSD Systematic Execution Model (Verified)

An institutional-grade algorithmic execution framework specifically engineered for the **XAUUSD (Gold)** spot market. This repository serves as a performance showcase and a high-level overview of a proprietary model developed by **Quant Vishal**.

## 🛡️ Confidentiality & NDA Notice
This strategy is governed by strict proprietary standards and Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDA). Consequently:

## 🧬 Architectural Philosophy
The model operates on a hybrid quantitative framework designed to capture non-linear price displacement in the Gold market.

### 1. Adaptive Volatility Gating
The system utilizes a dynamic volatility sieve to ensure capital exposure only occurs during high-liquidity trend phases. This proprietary filter effectively mitigates risk during low-volume "noise" periods and sideways market regimes.

### 2. Multi-Cycle Directional Alignment
Instead of relying on lagging technical indicators, the engine synchronizes price action across multiple time-cycles to confirm high-conviction entries. This ensures the model captures the core "Institutional Pulse" of the Gold market.

### 3. Structural Equity Protection
The framework employs a systematic recovery and layering mechanism designed to manage drawdowns mathematically. It prioritizes the "Basket Breakeven" price, ensuring that the aggregate portfolio maintains a positive expectancy even during short-term volatility bursts.
